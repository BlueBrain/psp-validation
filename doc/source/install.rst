Installation
============

pip install
-----------

``psp-validation`` is distributed as a Python package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install psp-validation

At this point, ``psp`` command should be available, as well as compatible ``BlueCelluLab``, ``SNAP`` and ``neuron``, as well as compiled MOD files.

Currently, Python 3.7+ is supported.

Getting BlueCelluLab / Neuron dependencies configured might be not straightforward, please refer to BlueCelluLab `installation instructions <https://bluecellulab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for the details.
